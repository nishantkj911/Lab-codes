1. find sum of given n nos using a 1D array using a function
2. Implement linear search on a list of integers
3. Find sum of 2 matrices using a function named add with suitable parameters
4. Find biggest in a list of nos using a function

Addl Exercises:

1. Random no. generation anf finding the frequency of occurence
Generate a large no of random nos(say around 10k). Each sample value should be b/w -100 and 100(ints). After generating the samples find the frequency of each distinct sample. Repeat the above steps with unknown size(Hint: user will decide at run time). The purpose is to realise adv. and disadv. of using array

2. Addition of polynomials with two terms
To perform different operations on polynomial with two terms x, y, using 2d array representations. Operations like addition and multiplicaiton have to be implemented [ref: J.P Trembly]. It the 2D array repr. is sparse then optimize the memory usage by using suitable alternative repr.x`
