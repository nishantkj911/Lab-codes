1) Write an algorithm and program to implement a doubly linked list with the following operations:
D   --Create the list by adding each node at the front
D	--Insert an new node to the left of the node whose key value is read as input
D	--Delete all occurrances of a given key if it is found, otherwise display an appropriate mssg.
D	--Search a node based on its key value
D   --Display the contents of the list

2) Write a program to construct a binary tree to support the following operations(assume no duplicate elements while constructing the tree):
D	--Given a key perform a search in the binary search tree. If the key is found, display a message else insert the key in the BST.
D	--Display the tree using inorder, preorder and postorder traversal methods.

3)WAP to implement the following graph representations and display them:
	--Adjacency List
	--Adjacency matrix
